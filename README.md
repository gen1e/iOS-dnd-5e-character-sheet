# iOS-dnd-5e-character-sheet
iOS class final project. App to keep track of your D&amp;D 5e character.


## Installing Realm
Exit xcode. Open a terminal and go to the root directory of the project. Run:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod init
```

Then open the Podfile and add the RealmSwift pod. Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

It will take quite a while. Make sure to **always open the project using the .xcworkspace file**. You can also use this command:

```bash
open DnD-5e-Character-Sheet.xcworkspace
```
